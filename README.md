# Shine A Light
This project was meticulously developed as part of our bachelor's degree programme, where a team of four students worked together to plan, build and test an immersive game called 'Shine A Light'. Using the capabilities of the renowned Unreal Engine, we employed industry-leading technology to create an exceptional gaming experience.

Central to our project was the creation of a compelling protagonist, Louri, the courageous tree frog. Using the versatile 3D modelling software Blender, we meticulously customised Louri's appearance and movements to ensure he fit seamlessly into our game world. Using Mixamo's animation resources, we brought Louri to life with fluid and realistic movements, enhancing the player's immersion in the game.

Leveraging the extensive capabilities of the Unreal Engine, we meticulously constructed two distinct levels that served as the foundation of our game's core experience. The first level immersed players in the eerie confines of an abandoned subway train, while the second level transported them to the enigmatic expanse of a harbour. Through careful level design, we aimed to create a compelling mix of curiosity, anticipation and challenge.

Throughout the development process, our team adopted a collaborative approach, pooling our collective expertise to refine ideas, tackle obstacles and optimise the gameplay experience. Many hours of meticulous playtesting and fine-tuning went into ensuring a polished and enjoyable journey for players.

## Idea
"Shine A Light" is an atmospheric and immersive game inspired by the likes of "Little Nightmares". Players are transported to an intriguing and mysterious world where the boundaries between different universes have blurred, causing chaos and confusion. In the midst of this unholy mess, a little frog named Louri finds himself on a heroic journey to restore order and balance to his world.

As Louri embarks on this treacherous adventure, players will witness the collision of different realms, each with its own unique atmosphere and visual style. From an abandoned subway train to the atmospheric vastness of a harbour, Shine A Light weaves a tapestry of diverse and immersive environments that evoke a constant sense of wonder and unease.

To progress, players must interact with the environment, strategically moving boxes, activating switches and uncovering hidden pathways. These actions are crucial to unlocking new areas and unlocking the secrets of each realm. "Shine A Light" rewards exploration and encourages players to carefully observe their surroundings, searching for clues and hidden artefacts that shed light on the overarching mystery.
